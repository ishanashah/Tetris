# Tetris
Java program that simulates a complete game of Tetris using wall-kicks, piece holding, and fair piece generation. Includes a genetic algorithm to generate an AI that plays Tetris and can clear up to 5,000,000 rows. Also includes a minimax algorithm that uses my AI to create an adversary that picks the “worst” possible next piece.
